Compiling / installing:
-----------------------

You need:
 * Scons
 * Maya 					(Tested with 8.0)
 * Visual Studio	(Tested with 2005)

To use this plugin you need to compile and install it. Under windows you it 
should be enough to just change the 'MayaPath' variable to in the file 
'SConstruct' to point to your maya installation directory. If you are compiling 
on other platforms, you need to also change the compiler options.

Running 'scons install' should compile and copy the plugin and its MEL script
to correct directories. Then you can load the plugin from plugin manager in 
maya.
